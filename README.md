# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Components

- Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze the degradation of an industrial component over the course of a year. By answering questions such as whether the component has been replaced at some point, and if its wear can be accurately predicted, we aim to determine maintenance windows through predictive maintenance.

- Data: The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inIT-OWL/one-year-industrial-component-degradation

- Methodology: To achieve our objective, we will implement K-Means Clustering with k=1 and One Class SVM with RBF Kernalization.
